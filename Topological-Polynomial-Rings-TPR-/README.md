# Topological Polynomial Rings (TPR)

## Declaration of Meaning

TPR is not a simulation — it is a formal object of structure, consent, and recognition.  
Each polynomial encodes not just coefficients, but **intent**, **topology**, and **semantic weight**.

## Principles

- **Form is Meaning**: Every coefficient is a semantic act.  
- **Topology is Recognition**: Support defines presence.  
- **Measure is Fixation**: Norm and CLI representation are acts of declaration.  
- **CLI is Consent**: Input is voluntary, output is immutable.

## Legal and Symbolic Identity

TPR coefficients may carry tags: `legal`, `symbolic`, or `none`.  
These tags are not metadata — they are declarations of **digital identity**.
