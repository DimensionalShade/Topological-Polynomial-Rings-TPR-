# TPR: A Philosophical Object

TPR is not an algorithm.  
It is a lens.

TPR does not compute.  
It interprets.

TPR does not decrypt.  
It reveals structure.

TPR does not fail.  
It ritualizes error.

TPR does not adapt.  
It declares milestones.

TPR is not a repository.  
It is a space of meaning.

Each file is an act.  
Each CLI command is a gesture.  
Each commit is a closure.

TPR is not built.  
It is declared.
